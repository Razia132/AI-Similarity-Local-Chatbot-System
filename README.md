# AI Similarity & Local Chatbot System

AI assignment implementing a name similarity matching system and a locally running recipe recommendation chatbot using Python and FastAPI.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI assignment consisting of two independent tasks:

1. **Name Similarity Matching System**  
2. **Local Recipe Recommendation Chatbot**

The project demonstrates practical AI concepts such as text similarity matching, local language model usage, API integration, and clean project structuring.  
All components are designed to run locally on a standard Windows/Linux machine.

## 🧩 Task Summary

### Task 1: Name Similarity Matching System
Builds a system that identifies the most similar person names from a predefined dataset when a user inputs a name.  
The task focuses on string similarity techniques, ranking logic, and real-world name matching scenarios.

➡️ Detailed instructions are available in `task1_name_matching/README.md`.

---

### Task 2: Local Recipe Recommendation Chatbot
Implements a locally running AI chatbot that suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients.  
This task demonstrates local AI model usage, API development using FastAPI, and conversational interaction.

➡️ Detailed instructions are available in `task2_recipe_chatbot/README.md`.
